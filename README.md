## Salssist: Your Beauty Business Assistant 💅🏾📋

Salssist is a smart back-office system designed for beauty professionals who want to stay compliant, organized, and stress-free. From managing licenses and checklists to tracking income and expenses, Salssist helps beauty entrepreneurs handle the *business* side of beauty with ease.

### ✨ Why I Built This
As someone with experience in the beauty industry, I saw a real need for a digital assistant that helps hairstylists and salon owners manage their professional responsibilities—without spreadsheets, scattered notes, or stress. Salssist is built by a beauty pro turned developer, made *for* beauty pros who want to grow.
